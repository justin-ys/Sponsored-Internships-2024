# How to contribute
Make a pull request to add any positions that you can confirm have sponsored visas for internationals in the past. One *company* per PR (you can add several positions for a single company). For the time being, please only add roles based in Canada/the US (including remote roles based in these locations).

Positions should have links attached to them, if possible. Write "Any" (or "Any Software-related") if they have sponsored a large number of different software roles in the past, and "Unknown" if you aren't sure which roles in particular they have sponsored. Use country flag emojis (e.g. 🇨🇦) in the "countries" tab to indicate which countries are sponsored, or "Any" or "Unknown". In the extra conditions tab, list any particular qualifications you may need in order to obtain sponsorship (e.g. "only sponsors 4th years", "only sponsors from X and Y universities", etc).

Ideally, you should find 2+ online sources (Reddit threads, articles, screenshots, whatever) to provide in the sources tab. Of course, if the company has publically stated they sponsor a role then that is enough evidence. If the source is yourself, and you are able to attach evidence (e.g. an email), please do so **with caution** and make 100% sure you are allowed to do so. If in doubt, don't. That being said, PRs with no sources from new Github accounts may be rejected.
